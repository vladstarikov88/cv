    <p>
      I'm a passionate frontend developer, one who loves playing with new tech, has worked with, built, modern single-page apps, experience integrating with RESTful API backends, can speak JSON and not be afraid to look deep into the backend source code. I have a flair for design, enjoy implementing good looking UIs along with a UX. I spend my time learning cutting-edge technologies every day, striving to make the best developer out of myself.

      I am highly motivated in expanding my horizons day by day for
      better performance, testing and user experience.
