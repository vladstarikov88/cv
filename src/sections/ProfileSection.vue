    <p>
      I'm a passionate frontend developer, one who loves playing with new tech, has worked with, built, modern single-page apps, experience integrating with RESTful API backends, can speak JSON and not be afraid to look deep into the backend source code. I have a flair for design, enjoy implementing good looking UIs along with a UX. I spend my time learning cutting-edge technologies every day, striving to make the best developer out of myself.

      I'm highly motivated in expanding my horizons day by day for better performance, testing and user experience.

      I'm able to estimate time, manage a team, make great interfaces and give the expected result. I am always ready for challenging and interesting tasks.
