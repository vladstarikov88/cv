    <p>
      I'm a passionate frontend developer, one who loves playing with new techs, building modern single-page apps, integrating RESTful APIs, a person who can speak JSON and is not afraid to look deep into the backend source code. I have a flair for design, so I enjoy implementing good looking UI. I spend my time learning cutting-edge technologies every day, striving to make myself better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm highly motivated in expanding my horizons day by day for better performance, testing and user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My key skills also include time estimating, team management, making great interfaces and giving the expected results. I salute challenges and interesting tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked with many companies from all over the world. These were Russia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, Israel, China. Therefore, I am open to new countries and cultures
